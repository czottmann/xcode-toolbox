## Scripts

### xcconfig-version-bump
[`xcconfig-version-bump`](xcconfig-version-bump) sets the value for a given key
in a `.xcconfig` and commits the updated file to git.
[Fish](https://fishshell.com/) script.

I use it to automatically increment `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` in the pre-build
step:

```bash
cd "${PROJECT_DIR}"
xcconfig-version-bump --file some.xcconfig --var CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION --bump
```

Can also be used to set the value of a variable in a `.xcconfig` file:

```bash
xcconfig-version-bump --file some.xcconfig --var MARKETING_VERSION --set 1.2.3
```
