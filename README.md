# Xcode toolbox

Scripts to help me with my Xcode projects.  Consider all scripts tagged with
`WORKSFORME`.  ðŸ˜‰  I'm not responsible for any damage caused by these scripts.


## Scripts

### xcactivitylog-grep-and-notify

Xcode is being stupidly ignorant to "halting errors" in some build steps. For
example, sometimes in the "Extract app intents metadata" phase of my builds, a
"halting error" might occur, but Xcode will still report a successful build. I
spent several hours chasing those hard-to-find issues, and finally decided to
write a script that would notify me if a specific string or pattern is found in
the build log.

[`xcactivitylog-grep-and-notify`](xcactivitylog-grep-and-notify) `gunzip`s the
most recent `. xcactivitylog` file found in a given path to `stdout`, greps for
a specific string or pattern, and throws up a notification if said
string/pattern is found.

```bash
xcactivitylog-grep-and-notify \
  --log-folder ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/My_App-somethingsomething/Logs/Build \
  --search-term "halting error" \
  --notification-message "ðŸ”´ Halting error in build log"
```

I run this script post-build.


### xcconfig-version-bump
[`xcconfig-version-bump`](xcconfig-version-bump) sets the value for a given key
in a `.xcconfig` and commits the updated file to git.
[Fish](https://fishshell.com/) script.

I use it to automatically increment `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` in the pre-build
step:

```bash
cd "${PROJECT_DIR}"
xcconfig-version-bump --file some.xcconfig --var CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION --bump
```

Can also be used to set the value of a variable in a `.xcconfig` file:

```bash
xcconfig-version-bump --file some.xcconfig --var MARKETING_VERSION --set 1.2.3
```
